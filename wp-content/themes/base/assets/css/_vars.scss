/**
 * Any variables you find set in inuit.css’ `_vars.scss` that you do not wish to
 * keep, simply redefine here. This means that if inuit.css, for example, sets
 * your `$base-font-size` at 16px and you wish it to be 14px, simply redeclare
 * that variable in this file. inuit.css ignores its own variables in favour of
 * using your own, so you can completely modify how inuit.css works without ever
 * having to alter the framework itself.
